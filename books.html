            This is the third book in the series that <i>J.W. Rowling</i>
            has written about the private detective Cormoran Strike,
            under the pseudonym <i>Robert Galbraith</i>. Although the course
            of crime investigation and the murder's way of thinking
            description is very interesting, the developing of
            the relationship between Cormoran and Robin, his secretary,
            is the best part. This book series has a television serie called C.B Strike.

            The preacher of the Redeemer's Church,
            <i>Timothy Keller</i>, presents a biblical perspective
            on the work in this book. Basically, it shows how we can
            love God and our fellow man through work, and how work is
            an essential part of human life. I found especially
            interesting the explanation
            of how we reflect the image of God through work, and how
            we work so many times with wrong motivations and then we
            have frustration in our professional lives.

            <i>Gabriel García Márquez</i> is the most important writer in my
            country, and his most popular book, <i>Cien Años de Soledad</i>,
            is one of my favorite books. However, when I was in high
            school I read another book by him, called <i>La Mala Hora</i>,
            and this book was terribly boring
            for me. At this moment I am reading
            <i>El Amor en los Tiempos de Cólera</i>, and although I still
            don't have my final perception, for now I think I like
            this book.
